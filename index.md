## Welcome to Journal Club on Neuroscience @FDU

Journal Club with specialization in Neuroscience (JCN) is an in-the-flash activity of URFB (Undergraduate Research Forum in Biology) at [FDU](http://www.fudan.edu.cn). Each week, an undergraduate student in FDU will share others with recent research or independent projects about neuroscience.

### Scheduled for 2020 Spring
**Due to the outbreak of ConV2019, the JC would be deliveried online, which will start from week 3 of this term.**

2. Yanan Wu's talk about [Cell-Surface Proteomic Profiling in the Fly Brain Uncovers Wiring Regulators](https://lingweizhang.github.io/JCN/2020Spring/02/paper1.pdf).
3. Yanming Zhu's talk about [Replay of cortical spiking sequences during human memory retrieval](https://lingweizhang.github.io/JCN/2020Spring/03/paper1.pdf).

### How to post your talk on the schedule

1. Fork the JCN-FDU repository.
2. Post your talk by modifying the [index.md](https://github.com/LingweiZhang/JCN-FDU) and adding related materials about your talk into the [2020Spring](https://github.com/LingweiZhang/JCN-FDU) folder.
3. Submit a push request for your modification.
4. Ask our [contact support](mailto:lwzhang921@gmail.com) to push your update to origin repository; you can also keep a separate clone of JCN in your github.
